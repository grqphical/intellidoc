# Intellidoc - Self-Hosted platform to easily search documents, notes, etc. with natural language

## ⚠️ Currently a Work In Progress

Built with Python, FastAPI, SQLite 3, and LanceDB

## Functional Goals
1. Allow users to create collections of uploaded documents
2. Use a local embedding model to create vectors of the document's text
3. Let users then search through their collections with natural language
4. Integrate with LLMs so that users can "talk to their documents"

## Installation

Right now, the project is not 100% complete so for now just clone the repo, install the requirements and run the `intellidoc.py` script
